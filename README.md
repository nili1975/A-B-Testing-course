# A-B-Testing-course
I'm learning to use T-TEST for knowing which of 2 posibbles is better for a specific target.
My task was to use a file that exist in the net and has data about clicking on 2 advertisements, 
I should answer the question if one of the advertisments is better then the other (has more clicks on it)
The average isn't enogh for determine it, we should also relate to the variance of the data anf because of that we shold use the T-Test (The difference between the averages in units of standard deviation)
